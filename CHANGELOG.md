# Changelog

All notable changes to the NVIDIA Cluster Readiness Engine (NVCRE) are documented in
this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Entries are distilled from the GitHub release notes for each tag;
the full pull request list for a release is in its release notes. Pre-release tags
(`-rc.N`) are not listed here; their changes appear under the stable release that
followed them.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- NCCL bandwidth gauges are now `nvcre_nccl_algbw_gbs` and `nvcre_nccl_busbw_gbs`
  (gigabytes per second). The previous `_gbps` names incorrectly implied gigabits;
  values have always been GB/s from nccl-tests. The old names remain dual-registered
  as deprecated aliases for one minor release and will be removed in the following
  minor (#408)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- Lifecycle Events for phase transitions on Certification, Workflow, Job, and
  WorkloadRun, so `kubectl describe` shows each transition; Failed transitions emit
  Warnings (#349)
- `workloadMetadata.labels` sets labels on the generated workload object, globally at
  `spec.workloadMetadata` and per category at
  `spec.categories[].options.workloadMetadata` (#353)
- The gang-scheduler queue label is written to the submitted workload object, not only
  the runtime Job and pod templates, so Kueue and KAI Scheduler read it where they
  expect it (#353)
- Cordoned nodes can be certified by adding a `target.taintSelectors` entry for the
  `node.kubernetes.io/unschedulable` taint, which also drops the hardware-failure
  check for the run (#358)

### Fixed

- `nvcrectl setup init` no longer rejects read-only JobSet consumer roles such as
  GKE's `system:clustermetrics` as a leftover JobSet controller, which blocked
  Kubeflow Trainer installation (#368)

### Security

- The reusable-workflow signing boundary is enforced by release-path tests: weakening
  `attest.yml`'s sole-signer boundary, its trusted-context provenance predicate, or
  the builder-identity guard now fails `make test` (#308)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added

- Admission-policy samples for Kyverno and Sigstore policy-controller that require the
  release signature and SLSA provenance on the controller image (#334)
- Runnable `Certification` and `WorkloadRun` examples under `examples/` (#355)

### Changed

- `nvcrectl setup init` and `setup reset` reject unknown `--skip-phases` values (#346)
- `nvcrectl setup init` stops before mutating the cluster when JobSet ownership is
  ambiguous and prints the manual Kubeflow Trainer install path (#346)

### Fixed

- `nvcrectl setup init` installs Kubeflow Trainer without its bundled JobSet
  controller when a verified external JobSet controller is present, and reset and
  recovery retain the shared JobSet CRD (#346)
- `--skip-phases=helm` on `setup init` and `setup reset` skips the Helm phase instead
  of being silently ignored; reset previously removed the NVCRE release and CRDs
  anyway (#346)
- A Kubeflow Trainer uninstall failure during `setup reset` stops before CRD cleanup
  and returns non-zero (#346)
- CRD descriptions for `spec.target.nodeNames` no longer claim `nodeSelector` is
  ignored; both filters have always applied (#356)

### Security

- A `workflow_dispatch` at any tag cut from `v0.4.0` onward can no longer mint the
  release signing identity: the attest self-test holds its ref to `main`, and
  `attest.yml` refuses `allow_untagged` on a release tag. `v0.3.0` and the `v0.2.0`
  series still ship the unguarded copy (#341)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- An sshd install guard and a workload image override for air-gapped clusters (#326)
- Mirrorable training source repositories via `sourceRepo` in catalog entries (#327)
- `--chart-ref` and `--trainer-chart-ref` flags on `nvcrectl setup init` (#328)
- An on-prem platform override for GB200 and GB300 (#331)
- A configurable gang scheduler queue label key (#332)
- Controller disruption protection in the Helm chart (#330)

### Changed

- The Kubernetes dependency group is held at 0.36.x until kubeflow/trainer supports
  1.37 (#315)

### Fixed

- Reports include captured failure logs (#316)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- Gang-scheduled certification runs: `spec.gangScheduler` opts every category's
  workload pods into a gang-aware scheduler such as KAI Scheduler (#303)
- Signatures and SLSA provenance for everything a release publishes: the container
  image with per-platform CycloneDX SBOMs, the Helm chart, the `nvcrectl` binaries,
  and the installer (#281, #286, #289, #290)
- A release verification gate: the GitHub Release stays a draft until every published
  artifact verifies against the exact signing identity (#293)
- The installer verifies each binary against that release's Sigstore bundle before
  installing it (#298)
- `manager.image.digest` Helm value to pin the controller image by digest instead of
  a mutable tag (#292)
- A weekly vulnerability scan of already-published images, for CVEs disclosed after
  those images were built (#305)
- NCCL path-spread tuning for OCI GB300 (#287)

### Changed

- Go 1.27 (#285)
- Versioned documentation is built from the frozen content the version registry
  points at, and publishes on release tags (#297, #260)

### Fixed

- `maxBytes` values are accepted again; the CRD pattern marker was quoted such that
  valid values were rejected at admission (#284)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-01

First stable release: a Kubernetes controller that certifies GPU clusters before
production use by running real training and communication workloads across
topology-aware node groups, measuring goodput and bandwidth, and reporting every
failed node with a reason.

### Added

- Catalog training entry CPU and memory are overridable via `CategoryOptions` (#232)
- `workloadrun run --cleanup` is implemented instead of silently discarded (#228)

### Changed

- The Helm chart is renamed to `cluster-readiness-engine` and published to the
  repo-linked GHCR package (#257)
- Install and release instructions use public download URLs (#255)

### Fixed

- Unknown threshold keys fail loudly instead of skipping validation (#227)
- The majority GPU architecture is certified on every path, not the first node's
  (#251, #254)
- Nodes with insufficient allocatable GPUs are excluded from partitioning (#231)
- A suspended TrainJob is treated as pending, not running (#238)
- Ownership is verified before adopting or deleting child resources (#239)
- Chart CRDs are applied on every `init` run to prevent schema drift on upgrade (#236)
- Certification and WorkloadRun specs are immutable after creation (#240)
- `spec.env` is passed to MPI containers instead of silently dropped (#230)
