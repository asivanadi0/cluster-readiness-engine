const ProductLabel = "nvidia.com/gpu.product"

// MajorityArchitecture returns the GPU architecture reported by the most
// nodes, parsed from each node's nvidia.com/gpu.product label via
// ParseProduct. It is the single source of truth for architecture detection:
// the controllers and every CLI path (render, cluster info, workloadrun)
// derive gpusPerNode, MNNVL, and override matching from its result, so a
// mixed-architecture target resolves to the same architecture everywhere
// (issue #248).
//
// Only labeled nodes vote. A node without the label (or with an empty value)
// never outvotes labeled nodes, so a fleet where the GPU feature-discovery
// labeler has not reached every node still detects the architecture the
// labeled nodes report. The function returns "" only when no node is labeled
// (including an empty input); callers map that to their own "unknown"
// sentinel or fallback.
//
// The winner is derived by walking the slice in order with a strictly-greater
// count comparison (the counts map is only indexed, never iterated), so the
// result is deterministic for a given node order and ties resolve to the
// architecture whose earliest node appears first. Callers pass name-sorted
// nodes, which makes the result stable for a given cluster. This is the exact
// tie-break the Workflow and Certification controllers adopted for issue #77.
