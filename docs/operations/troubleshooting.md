This page is for operators who need to diagnose problems with the NVIDIA Cluster Readiness Engine (NVCRE). Each section follows a problem-solution format: symptoms, diagnostic commands, and fixes.

## Read lifecycle Events

`kubectl describe` shows lifecycle Events for Certifications, Workflows, Jobs,
and WorkloadRuns. An `InProgress` or `Succeeded` transition is `Normal`; a
`Failed` transition is `Warning`. The Event reason and message match the
condition that was persisted on the object.

```bash
kubectl describe certifications.nvcre.nvidia.com <name> -n <namespace>
kubectl describe workflows.nvcre.nvidia.com <name> -n <namespace>
kubectl describe jobs.nvcre.nvidia.com <name> -n <namespace>
kubectl describe workloadruns.nvcre.nvidia.com <name> -n <namespace>
```

Job Events also report hardware and validation verdicts. A completed workload
emits `WorkloadCompleted`. If the Job configures thresholds, it subsequently
emits `ThresholdsMet` or the validation failure reason. Without thresholds,
there is no validation verdict Event. A hardware verdict leaves the Job phase
unchanged, but its parent Workflow treats the verdict as terminal for that
group attempt.

Event notes are limited to 1,024 bytes. Longer notes end with `... [truncated]`;
for phase and verdict Events, inspect the object's status conditions for the
full message.

GoodputMeasurement and BandwidthMeasurement do not emit phase-transition
Events. Inspect the owning Job for threshold verdicts; measurement-specific
action failures still appear on the measurement object.

Events are best-effort diagnostics, not the source of truth. Confirm the
current state in `.status.conditions`. Kubernetes retains Events according to
the API server's `--event-ttl` setting, which defaults to one hour, so older
transitions may no longer be present.

## Job not progressing

**Symptoms:** Job stays in `InProgress` for longer than expected. No `Succeeded` or `Failed` condition appears.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# Check the Job conditions
kubectl describe jobs.nvcre.nvidia.com <name> -n <namespace>

# Check the underlying workload (use the kind from status.workloadRef)
kubectl get trainjob -n <namespace>
kubectl get pods -l nvcre.nvidia.com/job=<name> -n <namespace> -o wide

# Check controller logs for this job
kubectl logs -n nvcre deploy/nvcre-manager \
  | grep <name>
```

**Solutions:**

- The `InProgress` condition has reason `WorkloadPending` — the workload is queued, not stuck. On Kueue-managed clusters the TrainJob is created with `spec.suspend: true` and held until quota is admitted. NVCRE waits without counting queued time against `timeoutPerJob` or stall detection; check the queue (`kubectl get workloads -A` for Kueue) to see why admission is not happening.
- The workload resource exists but is not completing — check Kubeflow Trainer logs and pod events.
- Pods are `Pending` — verify GPU resources are available on target nodes (`kubectl describe node <node>`).
- The `InProgress` condition has reason `WorkloadSchedulingBlocked` — the workload is admitted but its pods cannot be placed (e.g. GPUs held by another tenant). The condition message relays the scheduler's own diagnosis (also shown on the Workflow as reason `JobSchedulingBlocked` and as a `Blocked:` line in `nvcrectl certification report`); blocked time does not count against `timeoutPerJob` or stall detection. Tune with `spec.schedulingStallGraceSeconds` (default 5m).
- Kubeflow Trainer is not running — confirm its pods are healthy (`kubectl get pods -n kubeflow-system`).

## Workflow stuck without a Job

**Symptoms:** Workflow condition is `InProgress`, but no child Job appears.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# Check Workflow status and conditions
kubectl get workflows.nvcre.nvidia.com <name> -o yaml

# Look for the child Job
kubectl get jobs.nvcre.nvidia.com -l nvcre.nvidia.com/workflow=<name>

# Check if dependencies were created
kubectl get workflows.nvcre.nvidia.com <name> \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.dependencyRefs}' | jq .
```

**Solutions:**

- Dependency creation failed — check controller logs for RBAC errors when creating ConfigMaps, PVCs, or other dependency resources.
- Target nodes do not match — verify the Workflow's `nodeSelector` or `nodeNames` matches existing nodes (`kubectl get nodes -l <selector>`).
- The Workflow spec is invalid — look for validation errors in the controller logs.

## Workflow cleanup or deletion pauses on terminating pods

**Symptoms:** After a Job fails, times out, or the Workflow is deleted, the group stays `Running` (or the Workflow stays terminating) for a while, and dependency resources such as the ComputeDomain are not removed immediately.

This is expected: the controllers wait for the workload's pods to finish terminating before deleting the dependency resources that provide their DRA allocations. Deleting a ComputeDomain while pods are still terminating would revoke NVLink/NVSwitch channel allocations under running CUDA kernels and kill every pod process with CUDA error 719. The wait is bounded to 5 minutes per Job; after that, cleanup proceeds anyway and the controller logs a warning.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# See which pods the controller is waiting on
kubectl get pods -l nvcre.nvidia.com/job=<name> -n <namespace>

# Confirm the wait in the controller logs
kubectl logs -n nvcre deploy/nvcre-manager \
  | grep -E "still terminating|drain"
```

**Solutions:**

- Pods are terminating normally — no action needed; cleanup resumes as soon as they are gone.
- A pod is stuck `Terminating` (for example, its node is unreachable) — cleanup proceeds automatically after the 5-minute grace period. To unblock sooner, force-delete the pod: `kubectl delete pod <pod> --grace-period=0 --force`. **Only do this when the node is confirmed unreachable or the pod's processes are known to be dead**: force deletion removes the Pod object without waiting for its processes to stop, so the controller may then delete the ComputeDomain while CUDA kernels are still running on the node — the exact CUDA error 719 failure the drain wait exists to prevent.

## Failed with a name-collision reason

**Symptoms:** A Certification fails with reason `WorkflowNameCollision`, or a Workflow fails with reason `JobNameCollision` or `DependencyNameCollision`.

**What it means:** The name NVCRE generated for a child resource (a Workflow, a Job, or a dependency such as a PVC, ConfigMap, or TrainingRuntime) is already taken by an object NVCRE did not create. NVCRE never adopts such an object and never deletes it during cleanup — it fails the run instead, and the pre-existing object is left untouched.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# The condition message names the colliding object
kubectl get certifications.nvcre.nvidia.com <name> -n <namespace> -o yaml
kubectl get workflows.nvcre.nvidia.com <name> -n <namespace> -o yaml

# Inspect the colliding object's owners and labels
kubectl get <kind> <colliding-name> -n <namespace> -o yaml
```

**Solutions:**

- The colliding object belongs to someone else — run the certification in a dedicated namespace, or rename your Certification/Workflow so the generated child names no longer collide.
- The colliding object is a leftover from an earlier run that you no longer need — delete it manually, then re-create the Certification or Workflow.

If the colliding object is already being deleted (it has a `deletionTimestamp`), NVCRE does not fail: it retries with backoff until the name is released. This covers deleting and re-creating a same-named Certification or Workflow while the previous run's children are still terminating.

## Hardware failures not detected

**Symptoms:** A node has a known hardware problem, but the Job does not report the `HardwareFailed` condition.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# Verify pods are running on the expected nodes
kubectl get pods -l nvcre.nvidia.com/job=<name> -o wide

# Check that the pod label was injected
kubectl get pods -l nvcre.nvidia.com/job=<name> --show-labels

# Inspect the node for the expected conditions/taints
kubectl get node <node> -o yaml

# Check controller logs for CEL evaluation errors
kubectl logs -n nvcre deploy/nvcre-manager \
  | grep "CEL"
```

**Solutions:**

- The CEL expression has a syntax error — look for parse errors in controller logs. Test your expression against a node object.
- Pods are not scheduled on target nodes — the controller only evaluates nodes where Job pods are running. Verify pod placement.
- The pod label is missing — the controller injects `nvcre.nvidia.com/job` automatically. If pods were created before the controller started, they may lack the label.
- Node conditions or taints do not exist yet — NVCRE only reads node state; it relies on your cluster's health monitoring stack to set the conditions or taints your CEL expression checks. Verify with `kubectl describe node`.

## High reconciliation latency

**Symptoms:** Status updates are slow. The `nvcre_reconcile_duration_seconds` P95 is above 5 seconds.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# Check controller resource usage
kubectl top pod -n nvcre

# Check for API server throttling (429 responses)
kubectl logs -n nvcre deploy/nvcre-manager \
  | grep "throttling"
```

**Solutions:**

- Controller is resource-constrained — increase CPU and memory limits. See the [Deployment](./deployment.md) page for sizing guidance.
- Too many nodes per health check — large clusters increase CEL evaluation time. Consider splitting workloads across fewer nodes.
- API server is under load — check API server metrics and reduce concurrent reconciles if needed.

## Certification not progressing

**Symptoms:** Certification stays `InProgress` after Workflows have finished.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# Check category statuses
kubectl get certifications.nvcre.nvidia.com <name> \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.categoryStatuses}' | jq .

# List child Workflows
kubectl get workflows.nvcre.nvidia.com -l nvcre.nvidia.com/certification=<name>

# Check for CategoryNotFound errors
kubectl logs -n nvcre deploy/nvcre-manager \
  | grep "CategoryNotFound"
```

**Solutions:**

- A category is not registered in the catalog — the controller sets the Certification to `Failed` with reason `CategoryNotFound`. Verify your domain and variant values against `nvcrectl certification list-categories`.
- A child Workflow is still running — the Certification waits for all Workflows to complete before transitioning.

## Stall detection not triggering

**Symptoms:** A Job appears stuck but is not marked `Failed` with reason `WorkloadStalled`.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# Verify stallMultiplier is set on the Job
kubectl get jobs.nvcre.nvidia.com <name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.stallMultiplier}'

# Check if a GoodputMeasurement exists and has step data
kubectl get goodputmeasurement -l nvcre.nvidia.com/job=<name> -o yaml

# Look for avgStepTimeSec and lastStepTimestamp
kubectl get goodputmeasurement -l nvcre.nvidia.com/job=<name> \
  -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.avgStepTimeSec}'
```

**Solutions:**

- `stallMultiplier` is not set — stall detection is opt-in. Add `stallMultiplier` to the Job spec (e.g., `10` means stalled if no step for 10x average step time).
- No GoodputMeasurement exists — stall detection requires a GoodputMeasurement to provide `avgStepTimeSec` and `lastStepTimestamp`. Configure `goodputMeasurement` on the Job.
- Not enough training steps — the controller needs at least two non-warmup steps to compute `avgStepTimeSec`. Wait for the workload to produce more log output.

## BandwidthMeasurement not reporting results

**Symptoms:** A BandwidthMeasurement exists but `status.results` is empty.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# Check the BandwidthMeasurement status
kubectl get bandwidthmeasurement <name> -o yaml

# Verify the LogProfile has a bandwidthResult pattern
kubectl get logprofile <profile-name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.patterns.bandwidthResult}'

# Check pod logs for NCCL output
kubectl logs <pod-name> | head -50
```

**Solutions:**

- The LogProfile is missing the `bandwidthResult` pattern — BandwidthMeasurement requires a LogProfile with a `bandwidthResult` regex. Add it to the LogProfile spec.
- The regex does not match the NCCL output format — verify the regex against actual log output. NCCL test output format varies between versions.
- The workload has not produced output yet — bandwidth results appear only after the NCCL test completes its message-size sweep.
- The `replicatedJobName` is wrong — for MPI workloads, set `workerStrategy.replicatedJobName: launcher` in the LogProfile since NCCL output goes to the launcher pod.
- The `logProfileRef` does not name an existing LogProfile — check `kubectl get logprofile <name>`; LogProfiles are cluster-scoped.
- The LogProfile's `containerName` names no container in the launcher pod — the log read fails with an error from the API server. Leave it empty to read the pod's only container.

## Bandwidth threshold fails with MeasurementTimeout

**Symptoms:** A Job succeeded, but `ValidationFailed` is `True` with reason `MeasurementTimeout` for `busBandwidthGBps` or `algBandwidthGBps`, and its BandwidthMeasurement is `Complete` with reason `LogsUnavailable` or `NoDataCollected`.

Bandwidth thresholds are evaluated only against final results, read from the launcher's full log after the Job succeeds. The measurement could not produce them, so the value stays unmeasured and validation fails once `measurementTimeout` expires.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# The Complete condition's message names the cause
kubectl get bandwidthmeasurement <name> -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Complete")]}'

# Retries of the final read are recorded as Warning events
kubectl get events --field-selector involvedObject.name=<name>
```

**Solutions:**

- `LogsUnavailable` with an error reading the pod log — the launcher pod or its log was gone or unreachable for the whole retry period, or the LogProfile's `containerName` names no container in the pod. Check that nothing deletes the TrainJob or its pods before thresholds are evaluated, and that the controller can reach the kubelet for `pods/log`. If the log is only slow to become readable, raise `measurementTimeout`; the read is retried for as long as the Job waits (see [BandwidthMeasurement](../api-reference/bandwidth-measurement.md#how-it-works) for where to set it).
- `LogsUnavailable` with an error naming the LogProfile (`getting LogProfile ...`, a pattern that does not compile) or a missing pod (`no pods found for ... replicatedJob ...`) — the measurement never found the log to read. Check `logProfileRef` and `workerStrategy.replicatedJobName` as described in [BandwidthMeasurement not reporting results](#bandwidthmeasurement-not-reporting-results).
- `LogsUnavailable` because the log cannot be read in full — for example a line longer than 1 MiB. Retrying cannot help; reduce the workload's log output.
- `LogsUnavailable` because the referenced Job no longer exists — it was deleted, or replaced when its group was retried. The replacement Job gets its own BandwidthMeasurement.
- `NoDataCollected` — the whole log was read but no line matched the `bandwidthResult` pattern. See [BandwidthMeasurement not reporting results](#bandwidthmeasurement-not-reporting-results).

## Enable debug logging

For deeper investigation, enable debug-level logging by adding the flag to the manager container args:

```yaml
# In the Deployment spec
args:
  - --zap-log-level=1
```

This surfaces detailed reconciliation traces and CEL evaluation results.
