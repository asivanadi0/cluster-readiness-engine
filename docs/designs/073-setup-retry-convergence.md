# ADR-073: Convergent `setup init` Retry After a Partial Kubeflow Trainer Install

> **Status:** Accepted
>
> **Amended by:** [ADR-078](078-jobset-ownership.md) (accepted) — missing-JobSet-CRD checks before pinned-version skip, refusal on unknown release state, abort on Trainer uninstall failure, JobSet CRD retention, JobSet-instance recovery gating, and protection of unrelated resources in `kubeflow-system` during automatic recovery. The proposal reverses this record's accepted namespace-cleanup policy for resources within its protected inventory; Events, core `Endpoints`, and EndpointSlices are excluded. These amendments are accepted and in effect.

## Context

`nvcrectl setup init` installs Kubeflow Trainer by shelling out to `helm upgrade --install` ([`installTrainerHelmRelease`, helm.go:178-199](../../pkg/setup/helm.go#L178-L199)) with no server-side-apply, `--force`, or field-manager flags, and a retry of `setup init` runs the byte-identical command ([`installDepsPhase`, setup.go](../../pkg/setup/setup.go)). Field evidence from issue #180 shows this retry path can never converge after a partial install:

1. A first `setup init` failed partway through the `[deps]` phase, leaving the `kubeflow-trainer` Helm release in state `failed` with its webhook Secrets already created on the cluster.
2. The retry failed with **four certificate-data field-ownership conflicts across the two webhook Secrets** in `kubeflow-system` (the Trainer webhook cert Secret and the JobSet sub-chart's webhook cert Secret — `tls.crt`/`tls.key` on each). The kubeflow-trainer chart templates fresh self-signed certificate material on every render, so each retry tries to overwrite `data` fields whose ownership a plain Helm re-apply cannot take over.
3. `helm rollback` failed on the same four conflicts — Helm's own recovery tool re-applies through the same mechanics, so there is no Helm-native way out.
4. `nvcrectl setup status` reported **ready** while the Trainer Helm revision was `failed`. Issue #179 / PR #188 fixes the reporting half: it adds `helmStateFunc` plumbing that queries `helm status -o json` per managed release and blocks readiness on `failed`/`pending-*` states.
5. The recovery that actually worked was manual: `helm uninstall kubeflow-trainer`, delete its four CRDs (`trainjobs`, `trainingruntimes`, `clustertrainingruntimes` in `trainer.kubeflow.org`; `jobsets` in `jobset.x-k8s.io`), delete the `kubeflow-system` namespace, then re-run the pinned `setup init`.

> **Historical procedure:** step 5 records the recovery observed in issue #180. [ADR-078](078-jobset-ownership.md) proposes retaining JobSet CRDs and adding namespace-resource protection. An implementation of ADR-078 must use its amended procedure below, rather than copying this historical four-CRD deletion sequence.

So the reporting gap is closed by #188, but `setup init` itself still retries into a wall: an identical command against identical conflicted state produces an identical failure, forever. `setup init` needs to converge from any partial state, and it needs to do so without ever endangering user workloads.

## Decision

1. **Make the `[deps]` phase state-aware using the #188 plumbing.** Before touching the Trainer release, `setup init` queries its state through `helmStateFunc` ([PR #188, helm.go](../../pkg/setup/helm.go)). When the release is already `deployed` at the pinned `kubeflowTrainerVersion`, the phase prints "already deployed" and **skips the upgrade entirely** — never re-rendering the chart means never re-rolling the webhook certs, which removes the trigger surface from healthy retries, not just failed ones.

2. **Detect the failure class by attempt-then-classify, not by pre-probing.** When the release is not cleanly deployed, run `helm upgrade --install` once. If it fails, classify the captured output against the server-side-apply conflict signature — Helm's `conflict` wording with conflicting paths under `.data` of Secrets in `kubeflow-system` — and combine that with the release state (`failed` or `pending-*`) from `helmStateFunc`. Both signals must agree before the failure is treated as this class. A Secret `managedFields` probe is not the detector; it is recorded in the printed diagnostics only.

3. **Layered recovery: automatic only when provably safe, fail-fast otherwise.**
   - **(a) Automatic safe recovery.** When the failure is conflict-classified AND the safety gate passes (see decision 5), `setup init` performs the field-validated recovery itself, exactly once per run: `helm uninstall kubeflow-trainer` → delete the four `trainer.kubeflow.org`/`jobset.x-k8s.io` CRDs (reusing [`deleteCRDsByGroup`](../../pkg/setup/setup.go)) → delete the `kubeflow-system` namespace and wait ([`WaitForNamespaceDeletion`](../../pkg/setup/setup.go#L477)) → reinstall the pinned chart fresh. CRDs are deleted deliberately and reinstalled by the fresh chart install; the safety gate guarantees no instances exist, so no data is lost.
   - **(c) Fail fast with the exact procedure.** When the failure is conflict-classified but the safety gate does not pass — or classification is ambiguous — `setup init` fails with the manual recovery procedure from issue #180 printed verbatim (uninstall, the four CRD deletions, namespace deletion, pinned re-init) plus the reason automatic recovery was refused.
   - Option (b), Helm-level `--force` or `--take-ownership`, is rejected outright (see Alternatives Considered).

   > **Amendments from ADR-078 (accepted):** the following replace the corresponding instructions in decisions 1, 3(a), 3(c), 4, and 5:
   >
   > - **Pinned-version skip (1):** apply ADR-078 decision 2's JobSet CRD existence check before skipping. An absent CRD on a deployed release requires operator repair before either skip or upgrade; a failed CRD read stops the dependency phase. A present CRD preserves the pinned-version skip without a full ownership probe.
   > - **Unknown release state (4):** `helmStateUnknown` stops the dependency phase before skip or Helm mutation, reports the preserved state-query cause, and prints ADR-078's manual-install fallback, instead of `upgrade --install`. The install decision is now evidence-dependent, and an unreadable release cannot be classified as fresh or existing; the `unknown-state-attempts` case is replaced by that refusal.
   > - **Automatic recovery (3a):** require ADR-078 decision 4's operator-maintained quiescence and repeat its complete gate after confirmation before uninstalling Trainer. If uninstall fails, report the Helm error and possible partial outcome, and stop before CRD deletion, namespace deletion, or reinstall; do not claim rollback. Recheck workload blockers before each Trainer CRD deletion, retain `jobsets.jobset.x-k8s.io`, and perform fresh discovery and a final protected namespace inventory before namespace deletion. Compare against expected cleanup using preserved ownership and UID evidence; delete with the inspected namespace UID precondition, wait, then reinstall using the selected JobSet mode preserved under ADR-078 decision 2. Keep the existing SSA eligibility, confirmation, and one-attempt limit.
   > - **Manual guidance (3c):** explain blockers and omit JobSet CRD deletion from every recovery plan and manual procedure. Do not print unconditional namespace deletion when protected resources block it. On a late refusal, report partial completion and stop further deletion and automatic reinstall; do not claim that earlier cleanup was undone. Follow ADR-078's ownership guidance and manual-install fallback where applicable.
   > - **Safety rails (5):** preserve the TrainJob and non-Helm runtime blockers. Bundled-controller removal remains blocked by any JobSets; external JobSets outside `kubeflow-system` do not alone block recovery, while namespace-local JobSets and protected foreign resources do. Events, core `Endpoints`, and EndpointSlices are excluded as specified in ADR-078. Required inspection failures block recovery. Repeated checks cannot establish quiescence or eliminate check-to-delete races; ADR-078 replaces the absolute safety guarantee with protection conditional on operator-maintained quiescence, including the affected cluster-wide writes.
   >
   > Implementations of ADR-078 must update `trainerRecoveryCRDs`, `printManualTrainerRecovery`, `printTrainerRecoveryPlan`, and the actual cleanup operations together so none retains the old four-CRD deletion procedure. The original text remains here for the historical record; the amended instructions above govern.

4. **Enumerate the partial states and give each a deterministic action**, so `setup init` converges from any of them:

   | Observed state (Trainer release / NVCRE release) | `[deps]` action | `[helm]` action |
   |---|---|---|
   | not installed / not installed | fresh install | fresh install |
   | `deployed` at pinned version / any | skip (print "already deployed") | `upgrade --install` as today |
   | `deployed` at other version / any | `upgrade --install`; on failure, classify per decision 2 | as today |
   | `failed` or `pending-*` / any | attempt once → classify → recover (3a) or fail fast (3c) | reached only after `[deps]` converges |
   | `unknown` (state query could not complete) / any | `upgrade --install` as today; on failure, fail with raw Helm output | as today |

   The NVCRE release keeps its existing always-`upgrade --install` behavior: its chart renders no per-render certificate material, so it has no equivalent failure class. The same attempt-then-classify wrapper wraps it for symmetric error reporting, but with no automatic recovery arm.

5. **Safety rails.**
   - Automatic recovery is refused if **any `TrainJob` or `JobSet` instance exists** in the cluster — the same precondition the field recovery honored — or if any `TrainingRuntime`/`ClusterTrainingRuntime` exists that is not Helm-owned (missing the chart's `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: Helm` metadata), since deleting the CRDs would destroy it.
   - Recovery never touches anything outside the `kubeflow-trainer` release, its four CRDs, and the `kubeflow-system` namespace that `setup init` itself creates via `--create-namespace`.
   - Recovery appears in the interactive confirmation flow like every other destructive phase: in interactive mode the recovery plan is printed and re-confirmed via [`promptForConfirmation`](../../pkg/setup/setup.go) before anything is deleted; `--auto-approve` covers CI.
   - Every action is printed as it happens under a `[deps][recover]` prefix, and the final summary states what was uninstalled, deleted, and reinstalled.
   - Exactly one recovery attempt per `setup init` invocation. If the reinstall fails again, `setup init` fails with the manual procedure — no loops.

## Implementation

- **`pkg/setup/helm.go`** — extend the #188 plumbing: `helmReleaseState` already returns the state string; add `helmReleaseChartVersion` (from the same `helm status -o json` payload) for the pinned-version skip. Add `classifyTrainerInstallFailure(output string) failureClass` matching the SSA conflict signature (`conflict` wording + `.data.` paths + Secret references) — a plain classifier over the captured `runHelm` transcript.
- **`pkg/setup/setup.go`** — `installDepsPhase` becomes the state machine from decision 4. New helpers:
  - `planTrainerPhase(state, chartVersion string) trainerAction` — pure function returning skip / install / attempt-with-recovery.
  - `trainerRecoveryGate(ctx, c)` — lists `TrainJob`, `JobSet`, `TrainingRuntime`, `ClusterTrainingRuntime` instances via the unstructured-list pattern already used by [`anyNVCRECRsExist`](../../pkg/setup/setup.go) and returns (safe bool, blockers []string).
  - `recoverTrainerRelease(sp setupPhaseParams)` — composes the existing [`uninstallTrainerHelmRelease`](../../pkg/setup/helm.go), [`deleteCRDsByGroup`](../../pkg/setup/setup.go) for both API groups (both already exist for `setup reset`), namespace deletion + [`WaitForNamespaceDeletion`](../../pkg/setup/setup.go#L477), then [`installTrainerHelmRelease`](../../pkg/setup/helm.go).
  - `printManualTrainerRecovery(out)` — the issue #180 procedure, printed on every fail-fast path.
- **Helm subprocess injection** — thread a `trainerHelm` struct of function fields (`state`, `install`, `uninstall helmStateFunc`-style func types) through `setupPhaseParams`, defaulting to the real CLI-backed implementations. This is the same substitution shape `status_test.go` on the #179 branch uses for `helmStateFunc` (a stub closure over an `input.yaml` state map).
- **Unit tests (testutil golden, per repo policy)** — `pkg/setup/testdata/init-recovery/<case>/` with `input.yaml` carrying `{releaseState, chartVersion, helmOutput transcript, trainerCRs inventory}` and golden `expected.txt` carrying the classification, the chosen action, and the full printed plan. Cases: pinned-deployed-skip, failed-conflict-safe-recovers, failed-conflict-trainjob-exists-refuses, failed-conflict-custom-runtime-refuses, failed-nonconflict-fails-raw, pending-upgrade-conflict-recovers, unknown-state-attempts, recovery-reinstall-fails-once. Fakes follow [`pkg/setup/setup_test.go`](../../pkg/setup/setup_test.go) (`testutil.TestCaseParser`) and the #179 [`status_test.go`](../../pkg/setup/status_test.go) helm-stub pattern; the Kubernetes side uses the fake client builder already in `status_test.go`.
- **envtest conflict fixture (no live cluster)** — envtest runs a real kube-apiserver, so real SSA field ownership is available. A test in `pkg/setup` (envtest wired via `KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS`, as `cmd/integration` does):
  1. server-side-applies a webhook-shaped Secret as field manager `helm` (simulating the first install),
  2. force-applies different `tls.crt`/`tls.key` bytes as field manager `trainer-controller` (simulating the ownership takeover observed in the field),
  3. applies again as `helm` without force and captures the API server's 409 conflict listing the `.data` fields,
  4. feeds that real conflict text (wrapped in Helm's error framing) through `classifyTrainerInstallFailure` and golden-asserts the classification and the recovery decision.

  This pins the classifier to apiserver-generated conflict wording rather than a hand-written string.
- **Docs** — update `docs/cli-reference/setup.md` (recovery behavior, safety gate, printed manual procedure) and the troubleshooting section of the site's setup page.

## Rationale

- **Skip-when-deployed removes the trigger, not just the symptom.** Every `upgrade --install` re-render rolls new webhook cert bytes. Not re-applying a healthy pinned release is the cheapest possible convergence for the common retry, and makes `setup init` idempotent in the ordinary sense.
- **Attempt-then-classify over pre-probing.** A pre-flight `managedFields` probe would have to predict Helm's behavior; attempting once and classifying the real failure cannot be wrong about whether the failure occurs, handles transient non-conflict failures (timeouts, image pulls) naturally by not recovering, and keeps one code path for fresh installs and retries alike.
- **Two agreeing signals before destructive action.** Recovery uninstalls a release and deletes CRDs; requiring both the conflict signature and a `failed`/`pending-*` release state prevents a stray "conflict" substring in an unrelated error from triggering it.
- **Automatic recovery mirrors the field-validated procedure exactly.** The uninstall + 4 CRDs + namespace + pinned reinstall sequence is the only recovery known to work (issue #180); every building block already exists in `pkg/setup` for the `reset` path, so the recovery arm is composition, not new mechanics.
- **The TrainJob/JobSet gate matches the field precondition.** The manual recovery was performed on a cluster with no Trainer workloads; automating it is only defensible under the same precondition, extended to non-Helm-owned runtime CRs because CRD deletion destroys instances.
- **One attempt, loudly.** A single recovery attempt with every action printed keeps the tool debuggable; loops would mask genuinely broken clusters.

## Consequences

- **`setup init` becomes convergent**: from nothing-installed, trainer-failed, trainer-deployed-only, or both-deployed, a re-run reaches the same healthy end state or fails with an exact procedure. The issue #180 wall (identical retry, identical failure, forever) is closed.
- **`setup init` gains a destructive arm.** Even gated and confirmed, it deletes CRDs and a namespace. The safety gate, the interactive re-confirmation, and the one-attempt rule bound the blast radius; the fail-fast path is the default whenever safety is not provable.
- **Anything a user manually placed in `kubeflow-system` is removed by recovery.** The namespace is created and managed by `setup init`; this is documented, and the gate refuses when Trainer-family CRs exist, but arbitrary foreign objects (a user's ConfigMap) are not individually protected. Accepted: mirroring the field recovery beats partial cleanup that leaves the conflicted Secrets behind.
- **The conflict classifier couples to Helm/apiserver error wording.** The envtest fixture pins the apiserver half byte-for-byte and will fail on a wording change; the Helm framing half is matched loosely. Misclassification degrades to the fail-fast path, never to wrong recovery.
- **Pinned-version skip means `--set` drift on the Trainer release is not reconciled** until `kubeflowTrainerVersion` changes. Acceptable: `setup init` passes a fixed value set today, so there is nothing to drift.
- **`helm rollback` remains broken for this chart.** Out of scope — `nvcrectl` never invokes rollback, and the recovery path makes it unnecessary.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Helm-level fixes: `--force` or `--take-ownership` (option b).** Rejected. `--force` uses delete-and-recreate/replace semantics that can strand webhook configurations whose `caBundle` no longer matches the recreated Secret, and it does not resolve field ownership on all Helm versions. `--take-ownership` exists only on newer Helm, would silently raise `nvcrectl`'s minimum Helm version, and papers over the symptom: the chart still re-rolls cert bytes each render while another manager also writes the Secret, so the write-fight resumes on the next apply. Both also change behavior for every install, not just the broken retry.
- **Always uninstall-and-reinstall on any non-deployed state, unconditionally.** Rejected — turns every transient failure (registry timeout) into CRD deletion, and cannot be gated per-failure-class.
- **Pre-probe Secret `managedFields` as the primary detector.** Rejected — predicts rather than observes the failure, adds an API round-trip to every init, and still needs the attempt path for confirmation. Kept only as diagnostic output.
- **Fail fast only (option c alone), never recover automatically.** Rejected as the sole answer — the recovery is mechanical, field-validated, and composed entirely of code `setup reset` already has; making a CI pipeline hand-execute five printed steps is friction without added safety, given the gate. It remains the fallback arm.
- **Fix the chart upstream (cert-manager or stable cert generation) and wait.** Pursued in parallel as an upstream issue, but rejected as the fix here: `nvcrectl` pins `kubeflowTrainerVersion` and must converge with the charts that exist today.
- **Delete only the two conflicted Secrets instead of the release + namespace.** Rejected — leaves the release record `failed` (so `helm upgrade` history stays wedged and #188 keeps reporting unhealthy), and a partial first install may have left other orphans the release record never captured; the field-validated sweep is the only sequence proven to converge.

## Notes

- The four conflicts in the field failure map to `tls.crt` + `tls.key` on each of the two webhook Secrets (Trainer's and the JobSet sub-chart's) in `kubeflow-system`.
- The four CRDs deleted during recovery are `trainjobs.trainer.kubeflow.org`, `trainingruntimes.trainer.kubeflow.org`, `clustertrainingruntimes.trainer.kubeflow.org`, and `jobsets.jobset.x-k8s.io` — the same set `setup reset` already deletes via `deleteCRDsByGroup`.
- This ADR depends on issue #179 / PR #188 (`helmStateFunc`, release-state-aware `setup status`) landing first; the `[deps]` state machine consumes that plumbing unchanged.
- `envtest has no GC controller` (CLAUDE.md) is irrelevant here: the recovery deletes objects explicitly, and the envtest fixture only exercises SSA conflicts, not cascade deletion.
