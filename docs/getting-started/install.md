## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.29+ cluster with GPU nodes (the Certification CRD's CEL rules use the `quantity()` library, which the API server accepts in new CRD expressions from 1.29)
- `kubectl` configured and pointing at the target cluster
- NVIDIA GPU Operator installed
- Helm 3.x

## Install the CLI

Download and run the installer. It detects your OS and architecture and resolves
the newest stable release itself:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/NVIDIA/cluster-readiness-engine/releases/latest/download/installer | bash
```

To pin a version, download the installer from that release and pass the tag:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/NVIDIA/cluster-readiness-engine/releases/download/<tag>/installer | bash -s -- -v <tag>
```

The installer automatically downloads and verifies a SHA-256 checksum before installing. On air-gapped systems, ensure `checksums.txt` from the same release is reachable alongside the binary.

Verify the installation:

```bash
nvcrectl --version
```

## Set up the cluster

`nvcrectl setup init` installs the controller and its dependencies in two phases:

1. **deps** — Kubeflow Trainer (required for `TrainJob` workloads)
2. **helm** — NVCRE Helm chart (CRDs, controller deployment, built-in LogProfiles)

```bash
nvcrectl setup init
```

Setup detects the supported JobSet controller ownership pattern. A verified external JobSet controller is preserved and Trainer is installed without its bundled JobSet subchart. Ambiguous ownership stops before Helm mutation and prints an operator-managed fallback. An existing Trainer release with a missing JobSet CRD also stops: restore a compatible CRD using the intended JobSet installation procedure before rerunning setup. Existing JobSet CRDs are retained and are not automatically refreshed. For operator-managed Trainer or JobSet, you are responsible for keeping both CRD schemas, their controllers, and external consumers compatible. Automatic reconciliation of the shared JobSet CRD is deferred work that needs its own design.

### Registry access

The controller image and Helm chart are pulled anonymously from GHCR; no token is needed. If your cluster pulls from a private mirror or fork instead, pass `--image-pull-secret <github-token>` and the CLI creates the pull secret for you.

On clusters with restricted egress, both Helm charts can be pulled from a mirror registry with `--chart-ref` and `--trainer-chart-ref`; see [Deployment](../operations/deployment.md#restricted-egress-and-air-gapped-installs) for the full procedure.

## Verify

Check that the controller is running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n nvcre
```

Check that the CRDs are installed:

```bash
kubectl get crds | grep nvcre.nvidia.com
```

## Uninstall

```bash
nvcrectl setup reset
```

This removes all NVCRE custom resources, the controller, NVCRE CRDs, Kubeflow Trainer, and the three Trainer CRDs. The shared JobSet CRD is retained because deleting it destroys JobSets in every namespace. A Trainer uninstall error aborts the dependency cleanup before CRD deletion. To keep Kubeflow Trainer, pass `--skip-phases=deps`:

```bash
nvcrectl setup reset --skip-phases=deps
```
